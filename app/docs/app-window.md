# App window

VS Code window the Desktop icon opens (`app/launch.py`, `app/workspace.py`): look, pages, layout.
Measure in a scratch VS Code only (`JOBS_VSCODE_DIR`, [README](README.md)), never
the owner's own.

## Measured

- Look (`app/window/brand.py`, one token set): `workbench.colorCustomizations` per theme
  (`[Light Modern]`, `[Dark Modern]`) + `window.autoDetectColorScheme` => light by default, dark
  follows the computer; user's own theme elsewhere untouched. Yellow background = something a click
  does (buttons, Today's "Open the posting"), always under ink; owner 2026-10-03: yellow words that
  don't click read as broken buttons. Selected rows, badges, text selection = quiet grey. Contrast
  >= 4.5:1 per pair, tested.
- Pages: `markdown.styles: ["app/window/pages.css"]` - relative path joined to the first workspace
  folder (1.140 bundle read). Content sits in `.markdown-body`; body carries `vscode-light` /
  `vscode-dark` / `vscode-high-contrast`. Caladea via relative `url()` from `app/resume/fonts`
  loads (preview CSP font-src = webview source); seen live, scratch window, 2026-10-03.
- Scratch dir path must stay short: VS Code's IPC socket `<data>/1.14-main.sock` over 103 chars
  => window never opens, launch still exits 0. Use `mktemp -d /tmp/jfv.XXXX`.

### Profile + local extension (phase 2 groundwork)

VS Code 1.140.0 darwin-x64, 2026-10-03, scratch `--user-data-dir` + `--extensions-dir`, CLI only,
no window, Code never running there (no `code.lock`). Raw outputs + scripts:
[app-window/measure/](app-window/measure/).

| # | What | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cold profile create + 3 installs | Fresh data dir: write `User/globalStorage/storage.json` (`userDataProfiles [{location, name, icon}]` + `profileAssociations.workspaces {"<folder uri>": "<location>"}`) + make `User/profiles/<location>/`; then `--profile "CEZ Job Finder" --install-extension` pdf, yaml, claude-code | All 3 install, exit 0. `--list-extensions --profile` = exactly those 3; default profile list empty. Files once in the shared extensions dir, profile's list in `User/profiles/<location>/extensions.json`. `storage.json` untouched by CLI. Unknown profile: `Profile 'Nope' not found.` exit 1. `location` = path relative to `User/profiles`, id = its basename (bundle). |
| 1w | Windows folder key | `URI.file()` from vscode-uri 3.2.0 (VS Code's URI class) + bundle (`E.parse(key)`, compared w/ `extUri.isEqual`) | `C:\Home\Your Name\jobs` -> `file:///c%3A/Home/Your%20Name/jobs` (drive lower-cased, `:` -> `%3A`, spaces `%20`, non-ASCII UTF-8 escaped). Key is parsed, so `file:///C:/...` matches too. owner: pending - live Windows check (no Windows here). |
| 2 | Timings | wall clock per CLI call | Profile create (file write) 0.2 s. Install not yet in shared dir: pdf 3.5 s, yaml 2.9 s, claude-code 8.9 s. Already in shared dir (2nd profile): claude-code 3.0 s, pdf 2.0 s - still a gallery query each. Already in that profile: 0.6 s, "already installed". One call w/ 4 `--install-extension` (3 gallery + vsix): 3.0 s total - batch them. |
| 3 | Local vsix metadata + auto-update | Python-built vsix (`mkvsix.py`: manifest, `[Content_Types].xml`, `extension/package.json` + `extension.js`), id `cez-job-finder.window`, installed into the profile; bundle `shouldAutoUpdateExtension` | 0.8 s. Profile list only, default untouched. Metadata `source: "vsix"`, `pinned: true`, `isApplicationScoped: false`, `isMachineScoped: false`, no uuid. Pinned => never auto-updated. Same id on the Marketplace (not today: "not found") would show a manual Update button that swaps in the Marketplace build + unpins. |
| 4 | Reinstall vsix | same id: changed content same version; `--force`; bumped version; older version | Same version, new content: replaced w/o `--force` (file content changed), exit 0. `--force`: same. 0.0.2: installs, old folder marked in `.obsolete` (VS Code deletes it later). Back to 0.0.1: refused "A newer version ... Use '--force'" - exit 0 anyway => read output or always bump version. |
| 5 | Settings Sync | bundle read (no sign-in in scratch) | Extensions sync per profile sends every installed extension, vsix too, w/ `pinned` + version; another machine then installs that id at that version from the Marketplace - "not found" today, a squatted id later. Skipped: `isMachineScoped` extensions + `settingsSync.ignoredExtensions` (scope APPLICATION => only the default profile's user settings). Profiles are their own sync resource. To set: mark ours machine-scoped (metadata) or add the id to `ignoredExtensions` - only on a VS Code Job Finder installed (`vscode-ours`). Live sync check: owner: pending (needs a signed-in account). |
| 6 | Copilot model pick | bundle read (no Copilot sign-in in scratch) | Key `chat.currentLanguageModel.<location>[.<target>]` (location e.g. panel), storage scope PROFILE, target USER; an old APPLICATION-scope value migrates once into the current profile. Lives in `User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` (default) vs `User/profiles/<location>/globalStorage/state.vscdb` => new profile starts on Auto unless copied. |

## Phase 1 - what + why

Still stock VS Code, on the user's own install + subscriptions; only settings + page text change.

- Brand look: `workbench.colorCustomizations` per stock theme (`app/window/brand.py`), written to
  the workspace => only this folder's window changes, their own theme elsewhere untouched.
- Pages: `app/window/pages.css` (`markdown.styles`) - Caladea, 68ch measure, list items as cards.
  Reads as one program's pages, not a code editor's Markdown preview. No remote loads.
- Today: "Open the posting" + "Open its resume" link text, never a bare 100-char URL;
  "Open the posting" drawn as a yellow button (it opens the posting); words to say as plain bold
  quoted words (code spans) - user reads + types them; real buttons + a dashboard Today = phase 2
  (owner 2026-10-03). "What you can say" list at the end, same words.
- START HERE leaves the file list once search settings exist (`files.exclude`, written at
  launch => gone from next launch, plan-ejf.1.18 for right after setup). First-run steps only.
- Documents, not code: `[yaml]` + `[markdown]` w/o line numbers, folding, guides, lightbulbs,
  minimap; terminal hidden on startup (Copilot's agent runs steps there). YAML schema underline
  + hover kept: a mistyped resume fact shows at once, not hours later at render.
- `jobs.py open`: `code <folder> <file>` like the launcher, no `-r` => opens in the Job Finder
  window, not the last-used one.
- Employer text inert (`text.inert_md`): posting, Check before sending, Application answers,
  Follow-up, Today - no links, images or HTML from the employer. A hidden image can't tell them
  when the user looked; a link can't run a VS Code command. Our own posting link line kept.
- App-wide quiet keys (release notes, experiments, telemetry, walkthroughs; Windows: compact menu
  bar) in VS Code's user settings - only on a VS Code Job Finder installed (`.data/vscode-ours`,
  installers write it only when they download VS Code), or a settings file holding only Job
  Finder's own keys (installs before the marker). A developer's own VS Code stays byte for byte.

## Rejected

- Own Electron / Tauri shell: Claude, ChatGPT + Copilot chats exist only as VS Code extensions
  on the user's subscriptions - no shell can host them.
- `--user-data-dir` instance: every extension reinstalled, GitHub sign-in lost on Mac, every
  `code` call + sign-in callback must carry the flags, Dock still says "Code".
- VS Code Agents window (1.132): its extension allowlist excludes `anthropic.claude-code` +
  `openai.chatgpt`.
- Status bar hidden: Claude's item lives there.
- `workbench.editor.showTabs: none`: Claude's + ChatGPT's editor-title buttons go w/ the tabs.
- Zen mode: hides the chat.
- Activity bar hidden: ChatGPT's icon, Claude's sessions, + the only way back to the file list
  (resume drag onto My Resume).
- Problems / decorations off: loses the YAML red underline on a mistyped resume fact.
- `vscode://anthropic.claude-code/open` from a page: opens the chat as a tab over the page.
- `vscode://` handler for Today buttons: reachable from any web page or posting, not just ours.
